		<p> My alter ego is a Beautiful lioness.I was born and raise in the midwest. Iowa City,Iowa is my home town. I moved to Georgia 4 years ago and I have grown to like the big city of Atlanta but I still miss the slower pace of the midwest.  My educational background is in Law, mostly in Family Law. My hobbies are like soccer and music. I like long walks on the beach. One of my life long goal is to have my own Eat,Pray,Love experience in Italy.</p>
